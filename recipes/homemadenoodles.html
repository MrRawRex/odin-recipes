    <h1>Homemade Lasagna Sheets</h1>
    <p>Homemade lasagna noodles are easier to make than you think and you don't even need a pasta machine. And forget about blanching the sheets before baking — no precooking is required!</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups Italian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
        <p><h4>Step 1</h4></p>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 2</h4></p>
        <p>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt. </p>

        <p><h4>Step 3</h4></p>
        <p>Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Bring remaining flour into the mixture using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff. </p>

        <p><h4>Step 4</h4></p>
        <p>Knead dough with your hands by flattening, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes. </p>
        
        <p><h4>Step 5</h4></p>
        <p>Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>

        <p><h4>Step 6</h4></p>
        <p>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Take one piece and flatten it a bit with your hands. Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. Turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to 6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly very thin. When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your fingers through it. </p>

        <p><h4>Step 7</h4></p>
        <p>Cut pasta dough into rectangular sheets to fit your baking dish using a pastry wheel or a knife. Transfer lasagna sheets to a floured kitchen towel and let air-dry for about 30 minutes before assembling. </p>
