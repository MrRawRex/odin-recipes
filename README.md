# Project Presentation: Odin Recipes Website

## Introduction

Welcome, everyone! Today, I'm excited to present the Odin Recipes project, a website where I publish recipes I found online to practice my learned HTML skills. Let's dive into the journey of creating this web project step by step.

## Project Overview

The goal of Odin Recipes is to provide a platform where users can access to their favorite recipes. We've going to go into several iterations to build a solid foundation with the learn information in odin foundations course.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure

In the first iteration, we established the project's groundwork by creating the `index.html` file. This file serves as the main landing page for Odin Recipes, featuring a clean HTML structure and an inviting `<h1>` title, "Odin Recipes."

## Iteration 2: Recipe Pages

For the second iteration, we delved into creating individual recipe pages. Each recipe, such as "Lasagna," has its dedicated HTML file within the `recipes` directory. The index page was updated with links to these recipes, forming the core navigation structure.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

To enhance the user experience, we focused on the content of each recipe page in the third iteration. This includes adding an appealing image of the finished dish, a descriptive section, a list of ingredients, and a step-by-step guide to preparing the recipe.

## Iteration 4: Diversifying Recipes

In the final iteration, we expanded the recipe collection by adding two more recipes with consistent page structures. To improve navigation, all recipe links were organized neatly in an unordered list on the index page.

## Conclusion

The Odin Recipes project showcases the progressive development of a recipe-sharing website. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, resulting in a cohesive and user-friendly platform. Future plans involve incorporating CSS for styling and JavaScript for additional interactivity.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of creating Odin Recipes. Let's continue to explore the world of culinary delights together!
